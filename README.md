I implemented this logic directly into the game

note that I did this hack to the AES version, kof98h - because it was unencrypted

I believe that the code between the MVS and AES versions are the same

I'm working on the code to re-encrypt a decrypted kof98 so I can port this hack to that set, making it playable on fightcade


some of the files here are redundant.
